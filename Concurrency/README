// this program pretends to be an example on how to use posix threads
// mutex and shared memory to manipulate a shared resource
// the experient is the next:
// We will create 100 threads, each of them will increase by 1 the value of a
// shared variable (mySharedData)
// At the end the value of mySharedData variable should be equal to the number
// of threads.
